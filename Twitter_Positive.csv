I like to go to Philadelphia
For Gid so Loved the world.
I say enjoy the view. Turn the phone off and just unplug.  Nice to be signal free  at least for a little while...
T:mobile: it’s Tuesday!!! Make sure to come back at 1pm for a Starbucks gift card...   Also T-Mobile:
Would love to go Seattle
You supposedly ran out of gift cards when the app was down for an hour how is that even possible
What would you want to do with loved ones this holiday season?
The #TMobileTuesdays app is back up. Thanks for your patience.
I want to first thank God. Without Him this wouldn’t be possible. I also want to thank my parents for teaching me patience. Without it  I wouldn’t be here right now. I’d lastly like to thank all those who gave up and closed their apps so I could get into the app. Thank you.
@TMobile Is this what 5G will look like.  So much for trying to get in to Tmobile Tuesday at 4:00
@TMobile  thank you for the great service and fastest Nation wide data speed that I can’t get anywhere else service has been excellent
Well now the Starbucks page won’t work
Sweet! Thank you!
It's been over 24 hours where's my gift card?! #TMobileTuesdays
@TMobile has been a life changing experience since day one. My mentors and leaders have been phenomenal! 2020 vision ready! @beneph 
@TMobile clicked save and redeem and can’t get the site to load now 
Thanks a lot
@TMobile new hire in Augusta GA rocken my awesome t-mobile gift from this blessed uncarrier!!

@TMobile Good morning and thank you for the #TMobileGloves. I was able to use them in 16 degree weather here in Chicago. Here are a few pics at the bus stop! – at Student Civic Engagement Center - University Of Chicago
Thanks. Which are the prizes ???
It’s cool gift ever
This is what comes up for me. I want my Starbucks! 
Thanks!
Thanks Tmobile for my touch screen gloves.
@TMobile Yay!! Got my fine gloves!!! Love TMOBILE Tuesdays!!!
@TMobile  how long does it take to save $3 on a $6 cup of coffee? 31 minutes and counting...
After having tmobile for over a year I finally for 1 free merch item 
App crashed! LOL! Can’t get in to get a Starbucks discount.
Have it and love it 
Hopefully I can get my gloves... Since I won't be getting to have coffee to keep me warm 
Finally let me save then this kept happening and then it said they were gone.....
I hope i re-tweeted correctly? First time i tweeted  lol
@TMobile sigh
I got mine. Thanks!
@Tmobile I’m glad y’all helping military save money on the plan but the service is worth less
Thankssss Magenta I’m $3 richer
Thank you for the quick fix with the app. I was able to redeem my Starbucks gift card. Thanks again 
@TMobile I was wondering what this is. I'm not complaining or anything but I claimed it before reading what is said .
@TMobile at its best
Got mine thanks @tmobile
These are so cool!!! Cant wait to show them off !! Lol!!
Only made twitter for T-Mobile. You guys are awesome!
That’s bc the Starbucks promotion has ended. . I didn’t get mine.  Sure I’m not the only one.
Calling all of those who were first to Nationwide 5G  show us your flex! Shout out to our friends @OnePlus_USA   To Enter:…
Retweet @TMobile #RingInTheReunionsSweeps Wishing everyone luck!
@TMobile  when trying to get a free $3 @Starbucks gift card from tmobile tuesday.  Criess
@tmobile what is the deal? Data is not working. I shouldn't have to pay for something that isn't working. I wouldn't need data IF I only relied on wifi. #wastingmoney

Can’t offer up free things if your customers can’t even access it 
To make up for this mistake  I demand free stuff! Let’s say  weekly. Deal?
And now I’m getting this when I hit redeem. Thanks @TMobile @TMobileHelp 
Even though the #TmobileTuesdays app crashed right at 4PM ET start and the al freaked out. I'm thankful I got the $3 to Starbucks in the end.
Y’all are joking right?
@TMobile I am happy to accept this spray bottle in lieu of the Starbucks offer since the app failed.   I need some Windex.   #TMobileTuesdays
Time to do my #5GFlexContest with my amazing Note 10+ 5G!!! I hope @PlymouthPasty can join me soon courtesy of @TMobile and @OnePlus_USA so he can FLEX!!
#RingInTheReunionsSweeps take us home for the holidays! From the west coast to the east coast  our daughter would love to see her grandma in person. TMobile keeps us connected via video chat but there’s no place like home with a warm hug from grandma!
Someone will sure be blessed !! #RingInTheReunionsSweeps
#RingInTheReunionsSweeps  thanks so much for the amazing giveaway opportunity and good luck to everyone @goblinkinglbOG @KrissieW826 @PhinneyVicki @AngieFalangi @MissMiles517

Wow this would be amazing! @angelshearl1979 #ringinthereunionsweeps
@tmobile #binge on. Please add CW network
@TMobile maybe you should specify EST vs PST when giving out promotions! I got a notification to check the app at 4 pm for a starbucks card.... well at 4 pm it said it had ended? Notice the time... #tmobiletuesdaysisajoke
And now this. What a joke
Literally had my alarm set  then went on the computer as well lol. pic.twitter.com/9NbSVZ1AXz
@tmobile will there be a solution? #TMobileTuesdays
T-Mobile  your app and server can’t handle all the web traffic and 4PM EST.   Give everyone a $3 gift card at Starbucks.
Thanks
