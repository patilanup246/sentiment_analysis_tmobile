I have T-Mobile and i never got free WiFi on my flight so what do you mean
Are you going to do anything for those who missed out because of the app and website crashing? #DoWhatIsRight
@TMobile Tuesday deal was rigged. Coffee drop at 4pm. Logged in at 3:59p and deal wasn't available. At 4:00p site under maintenance. Refresh at 4:00p still and then deal was expired. Seriously? That's bullshit. pic.twitter.com/lFWZF5zaqe
Even though it's cold in my home state  I miss my family and I would deal with the weather just to see them.
@TMobile so I guess we should just forget about this ?
I WISH I COULF GET IT BUT IM BROKE ASFU (Looks epic)
@TMobile @JonFreier @JohnLegere what's up with 5G in the Portland metro area?? Using a 5G McLaren and do speeds are slower than my 7 Pro :(
@TMobile the only one with an app that is still failing after an hour attempt  so much for #TMobileTuesdays
When a $3 Starbucks giftcard broke T-Mobile Tuesday...

@TMobile REALLY annoyed !!! Please fix !! I was able to get the code and I added my email and then it crashed! So so so so fed up and disappointed!!!
@TMobile T-Mobile Tuesday’s isn’t working for the Starbucks card :(

@TMobile makes #5G and then their 4GLTE goes to shit 
@JohnLegere  wanna hook me a broke guy with a new iPhone  #help
@TMobile yep  that's a fail. #TMobileTuesdaysfail
Hell yeah
@TMobile Stop. Emailing. Me.
Upsetting that I could grab one app/ website was not working ...@JohnLegere @TMobileHelp
I missed out on the Starbucks card because the app was overwhelmed. You’re a telecommunications company  doesn’t that embarrass you? It should.
@TMobile @TMobileHelp I have some complaints #TMobileTuesdays
@TMobile #TMobileTuesdays fail for a Starbucks Gift Card #feelsbadman
To bad the site down
