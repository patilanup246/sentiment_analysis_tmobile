Bro T-Mobile, y‚Äôall gave my number to the world or something ? I get 10 calls a day from numbers i don‚Äôt know !
I'm really happy that LinusTech did this video about 5G phones. Too many people I have had to talk to about these wavelengths and cell reception and how "harmful" they claim them to be with absolutely no backed research to prove these claims. The wavelengths are too small to do damage and typically get absorbed very easily.  You also won't typically be using that wavelength for any cellphone call as it would be impeded and blocked if anyone is travelling, especially in a car....  It would just resort to your traditional radio frequencies. Furthermore, for data and downloads.  5G data streaming will only happen during active times of large downloads, or frequent online access while not on standby or not being used.  If you are using car play for example, the phone will likely just resort to typical LTE frequencies as your car will mostly block 5G waves. Thank you again Linus and T-Mobile See more

A big shout out to t-mobil for their always amazing customer service. Today Sheila went above and beyond when i called because I was having a issue making a international call. Shelia tried over the span of a few hours to reach them and even sent them emails and searched other ways to reach them all because I told her that I had purchased something from them that was the only thing my son had really wanted for Christmas and I don‚Äôt think they have sent my order from Germany! She just went the extra mile! Thank you t-mobil!

Congratulations to our all-star finalists in the Project Manager of the Year category, April Magliaro and Cristina Iacona.  #HeroesofTelecom #Sitetracker #telecom #infrastructure
Brand new to T-Mobile and just wanted to say I‚Äôm happy with the service however lying about paying off another competitors lease is mis leading and wrong.  FYI you get T-Mobile account credit they don‚Äôt help you pay your phone so BE CAREFUL!!
Why does your app always log me out.  Every other app I say to keep me logged in or remember my password does but yours. It's super annoying.Why does your app always log me out.  Every other app I say to keep me logged in or remember my password does but yours. It's super annoying.
No good offers to existing customers
T-Mobile don‚Äôt give any offers to existing customers like buy one get one free phones ... Only great offers are give to attract new customers. What about the existing loyal customers?

T-Mobile, OnePlus just released another update for the 7 Pro with Googles November security fix. Why can't you seem to get us past the September update?? Seems since you've removed the phone from your inventory you've also removed updates to an 8 month old phone. A way to get people to upgrade??
Grand Rising from me & the networks of... Cortez Epps, JSD International LLC, Jody Styles Detroit, JSD Raw Money, JSD Security PLUS, JSD Real Estate, TrƒÅ Vi, T-Mobile & MORE. All can be found on my mobile app explore & enjoy
I think it's time for TMobile to try something different in phone sales, the prices are getting too high, can't afford 2 years of monthly payments anymore, leasing a nice new IPhone for 10 a month sounds good to me!
