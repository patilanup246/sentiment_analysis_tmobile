T-Mobile how are you going to give me a killer deal on an iPhone 11 that you‚Äôre out of?! My hearts breaking over this backorder üò≠üòÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Please help!!!
Starting a new phone plan tomorrow. Sprint is the cheapest option but their network is questionable. The next cheapest option ‚Äî for the iPhone 11 and an unlimited plan ‚Äî is T-Mobile. Overall, the T-Mobile plan is $30-40 cheaper per month than AT&T and Verizon. So, have any of you had experience with T-Mobile? If so, are you able to give me some insight on their customer service, data coverage/speed and overall quality?
AT&T I can‚Äôt live these lies no more!   I‚Äôve been talking to T-Mobile! She‚Äôs got that good good.... #17years #immovingon See more
More crappy service from T-mobile. Chatted with support about returning a device, they said I could take it in or use the label they were sending me to mail it. I tried to be nice and drop it off, but then at the store they say, "Since we sent you a label, you HAVE to send it in".  I call techsupport and they give me the same BS.  Thanks for wasting 20 minutes of my time so now I can go home and waste even more time printing a label, and packaging up my device and then tomorrow I get to make another trip out to mail it. Is there actually a mobile carrier out there that has real customer service?  So far I haven't found one.
@tmobile I just received the absolute worst customer service and have been asked to pay outrageous fraudulent charges.  After being a loyal customer for more than 12 years, I was treated terrible and I will be leaving for good.  Charging me $400 for an 8 year old piece of equipment that I never used or even asked for is just plain wrong. You‚Äôve lost a customer for life, nor would I ever recommend you to anyone in the future.  I really hope someone sees this and tries to reach out to make it right.
T-Mobile You A Bitch My Nigga‚ùóÔ∏è
What is wrong with your website? You get what you pay for when you hire fake software engineers.
Hey T-Mobile!  My son Patrick Massengilland his friend Eduardo Jimenez were just in one of your stores while it was being robbed.  The employees abandoned them and ran in the back to save themselves.  Is this what you teach your employees to do??  My kids could have been hurt!  You need to do a better job with this!  Unacceptable!!
First off ü§£ü§£ü§£ at everyone that was whining over the Starbucks GC its THREE DOLLARS. On to my real issue. Been a customer going on 15yrs. Never really had any issues. This most recent issue kinda has me bugged though.  On the 10th I started 2 new lines on my acct. Got an iPhone 11 for my wife's move from sprint and that went smoothly. However, the second line that was added we did the B1G1 on the S10 5G. When we ordered our ship out date for the phones was marked 12/10/19-12/1...2/19. With 2 day shipping. So should be expected to get them within a week. There was a payment issue(which was fixed while still at the store) once fixed and order was processed. Our ship out date for the S10's had been bumped to mid-January.  So........ WTF.  The S10 5G's were both supposed to be christmas gifts. So what the hell happened to bump the shipment back. It literally took ten minutes to correct the payment issue and that somehow bumped the new phones back by over a month? Not to mention a phone line that cant be used until the phone gets here.

My family just switched from Verizon less than a month ago,  the discounts that we should be receiving on our new IPhone 11‚Äôs aren‚Äôt showing in the bill and the BS I was told was because the bill was generated before the promotion.  I find that hard to believe since the promotion is how we got the phones day 1.  Scam!  Then I was told they would match the discount from Verizon, to bring in my last bill for proof.  Just brought it in and they said because it wasn‚Äôt within 9 days they refused to match the discount.  That is a bunch of CRAP!  We were never told it had to be within so many days and I am so angry,  I will tell everyone I know to stay away from tMobile. Since they don‚Äôt follow through with what they publicize!!!  Ridiculous!!!!!!!!!
I know I am a drop in the bucket to you.I have never been so lied to in my life like the last 2 days. Plus no one wants to correct anything. I have been with t mobile 15 yrs. After all my equipment is paid off I am leaving. When that happens it will be 17 yrs. It is so easy doing nothing over the phone than in person. I will not recommend anyone.
T-Mobile COUNT Your fucking days BITCH üó£‚ÄºÔ∏è
They screw you I had a xs max which was stolen but someone was able to make a claim thru apple care using the imei which took a claim away from me thru Assurant which they recommended me filing a lost/stolen so whoever had the phone couldn‚Äôt make no more claims guys named Donald from Tmobile was on the phone with Assurant and apple trying to tell them it fraud but Assurant said it counts against her claim even if its thru apple care and apple said we can‚Äôt remove the claim so... Tmobile said we will notate the account in case if any happens to your new phone we will be able to do a in-house claim which this all happened in oct fast forward to last week my daughter who is adhd and 9 yrs old lost my phone at the mall now I contact them they claim they cant pull up the calls from the exact date I talked to them and Donald never notated the account and they could simply speak with apple to verified the claim was fraud and Assurant will tell them they cant approve my claim because apple can‚Äôt remove it and they could simply do the right thing but is choosing not too and it‚Äôs a shame See more
